# Academic Journal LaTeX Template

This is a LaTeX template for academic scientific journals. The template is designed to have the title and abstract span the full width of the page, while the rest of the content is formatted in two columns. The template uses the Computer Modern font and includes support for equations, figures, and tables. The bibliography is generated using Biber.

## Usage

To use the template, simply download the `main.tex` file and open it in your preferred LaTeX editor. You can modify the template to suit your needs, including changing the title, adding or removing sections, and including your own content. 

The `references.bib` file contains example references in BibTeX format. You can modify this file to include your own references. 

To generate the output PDF file, you can use your preferred LaTeX compiler, such as `pdflatex`.
